          <p class="fw-bold"><u>The lowest maintenance costs of the pump and head</u></p>
          <p>Kimla is equipped with a high-pressure pump with a pressure booster and accessories from the renowned
            American company Accustream. Accustream pumps have the lowest maintenance costs of approximately $ 1.25 per
            hour of operation. It is worth noting that the maintenance costs of some manufacturers' pumps are even four
            times higher. This is particularly important because in the competitive market of waterjet services,
            operating costs may determine the success of a project.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Adjustment of the amount of abrasive</u></p>
          <p>Kimla machines are equipped with the Accustream abrasive regulator with smoothly regulated amount of the
            garnet delivered to the head. This allows for precise adjustment of the amount of abrasive to the material
            being cut and specific machining conditions.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Compact design that takes up little space</u></p>
          <p>Kimla's waterjet machines are characterized by an extremely compact design that requires little space and
            is
            convenient to operate. Access to the material lying on the bath grate is possible from four sides and allows
            the operator to freely operate the material and collect the cut details.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Abrasive hopper 300kg with charging system</u></p>
          <p>The abrasive tanks supplied with Kimla machines have a
            capacity of 200 liters, which allows for many hours of cutting without having to interrupt work to replenish
            the abrasive. The charging container allows for convenient replenishment of the abrasive by using an
            automatically rising mushroom valve.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Smooth adjustment of the cutting</u></p>
          <p>speed The feed speed when cutting on waterjet machines depends on the type of material, its thickness and
            the
            quality we want to achieve. In some machines, it is not possible to choose a different feed speed than the
            manufacturer assumed. Kimla machines can infinitely adjust the feed speed, allowing the operator to adjust
            the
            speed to specific requirements.</p>
          AC
          <p class="fw-bold"><u> digital servo drives</u></p>
          <p>Waterjet machines should be driven by motors that allow reliable and repeatable
            reproduction of the workpiece. Therefore, drives should not be spared. Some companies (including reputable
            ones) use stepper motors for feed drive, which do not have position feedback and in the event of overload
            may
            lose this position "lose steps" destroying all material. Kimla waterjet machines use modern AC servo drives
            with vector control and position feedback for continuous control of the head position.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>RTE</u></p>
          <p>Interpolator Most control systems for cnc machines have had a similar logical structure of servo drive
            regulators for many years. It is a serial architecture. The set position from the interpolator is compared
            with the measured value and the deviation is transmitted to the position regulator, the speed is set from
            its
            output, the output of the speed controller gives a moment and only at the end is the servo drive. This
            approach causes significant delays 1/4 of the regulation, limiting the dynamics of regulation. Kimla
            machines
            use a regulator with parallel setting of position, speed, torque and spurt, which was possible thanks to the
            very fast data transmission between the interpolator and servo drives using real-time Ethernet (RTE). As a
            result, the dynamic accuracy of the machines has increased significantly. This is especially evident at high
            speeds and complex shapes.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Low pressure piercing</u></p>
          <p>Some materials such as glass, stone ceramics, are prone to cracking and chipping during piercing. Kimla
            machines are therefore equipped with the possibility of low-pressure piercing, which makes it possible to
            limit the impact force of the jet when piercing the material.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Toolpath</u></p>
          <p>generation software In waterjet machines, it is extremely important to dynamically control the speed of
            work,
            which should depend on the shape of the tool path. The software of Kimla machines has the ability to
            automatically generate tool paths based on dxf, plt, etc. files. and allows you to draw elements in the
            built-in editor. The toolpath generation module automatically generates the tool route taking into account
            the
            dynamics of speed and the diameter of the cutting stream. This is extremely important because many machines
            from other manufacturers, especially cheap ones (e.g. Chinese), try to use control systems for milling
            machines in their machines, which forces them to work at the lowest speeds at a given shape. The efficiency
            of
            such a solution is many times lower than that of Kimla machines and other leading manufacturers of waterjet
            machines.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Electronic gate angle correction</u></p>
          <p>The use of a gate moving on a narrower side of the working area causes a significant increase in the
            convenience of operation, but some manufacturers have problems with maintaining the correct angle of the
            gate
            due to its flexibility and lack of synchronization between its drives from both sides. Kimla has developed
            and
            implemented an electronic gate angle correction system that, when switched on, automatically sets the
            correct
            angle regardless of the initial setting of the drives.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>The control systems of</u></p>
          <p>numerical machine tools, due to their very rapid development, age (substantively) up to ten times faster
            than
            their mechanics. The control system in a ten-year-old machine often looks as archaic as a century-old
            mechanic. Due to the rapid development, we have integrated a module with the control system that allows 1/4
            more upgrade of the control system software. Kimla also offers long-term customers the replacement of entire
            control systems at a very attractive cost.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Advanced diagnostics - oscilloscope</u></p>
          <p>A diagnostic module has been integrated into the control system, which enables remote servicing and
            diagnostics of the control system, which significantly facilitates and speeds up troubleshooting.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Linear rolling bearings with preload</u></p>
          <p>All Kimla machines are linearly bearing
            using a
            system of guides and rolling blocks with preload. This ensures high rigidity of the driving elements and
            their
            durability is counted in tens of thousands of kilometers.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Possibility of adjusting the grate</u></p>
          <p>During multiple changes of the grate, due to the inaccuracies of the ribs made by users, it is possible to
            precisely adjust the height of the grate so that the gap between the nozzle and the material is always
            within
            the optimal range.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u> Cutting in five axes</u></p>
          <p>Our company is proud to present its proprietary solution for five-axis waterjet cutting. The control system
            allows you to procate directly from the program in three modes: fixed wall angle (also on arcs), fixed head
            angle and radial deflection, in addition, the path can be controlled using G-CODE. Innovative solutions in
            the
            field of construction and control system of our waterjets were appreciated and honored with the Gold Medal
            at
            the Poznań International Fair ITM.</p>
          <img src="./assets/img/gallery/waterjet/glowice-waterjet.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Dual synchronized gate drive</u></p>
          <p>Due to the large width of the gate, Kimla machines are always equipped with a double independent gate drive
            on
            servo drives on both sides, which avoids twisting and angulation of the gate, which is the case with single
            drives.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>High operating speeds and accelerations</u></p>
          <p>Most waterjet users are convinced that these machines are slow and do not develop high machining speeds.
            However, the speed of development of waterjet technology is so high that it is necessary to verify these
            claims. Thin and relatively soft materials such as aluminum, ceramics, etc. it is possible to cut much
            faster
            today than a few years ago and for this reason with these materials the limit of cutting speed is often no
            longer the waterjet cutting technology itself, but the limitations resulting from the capabilities of the
            control system and drives. Kimla machines are therefore equipped with solutions that enable operating speeds
            of up to 0.5m/s. This results in the possibility of even repeatedly increasing the cutting efficiency,
            especially with thin materials.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Rigid spatial bath construction and self-supporting</u></p>
          <p>structure The main geometric concepts of the bodies of the waterjet cutting machine are basically divided
            into
            monolithic solutions and those in which the bath with grate and material are not mechanically connected to
            the
            head positioning kit. Some manufacturers explain that the separation of the bath from the coordination
            system
            with the head has a beneficial effect on the processing, since vibrations do not transfer. Vibrations first
            of
            all should not be. And once they are, the cutting head and the cut material should move together. This is
            the
            case in the monolithic version, in which the coordination system is mounted on the bath. There is then no
            relative movement between these elements, which has a positive effect on the accuracy of machining. We can
            propose both solutions depending on individual beliefs, but we tend towards a monolithic solution. Another
            aspect is the boom or gate, but here there is no doubt that a mutually supported gate with independent
            drives
            is a better solution and even companies that used a boom eventually withdraw from such solutions.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u> Convenient movable control</u></p>
          <p>panel Kimla machines are equipped with a mobile control panel that can be moved in a range of several
            meters,
            which allows convenient control of the machine.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Hot-dip galvanized Waterjet bathtub</u></p>
          <p>is a considerable expense and therefore a machine of this type has to work for many years. Sand and water
            will
            damage the best varnish and after a few years the machines only with the varnish coating look very old, They
            are corroded and battered. Our machines are hot-dip galvanized before painting, which ensures deep zinc
            penetration enabling long-term corrosion protection.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Stainless steel</u></p>
          <p>finishes Despite the zinc, there are elements particularly vulnerable to ragging and damage. In such cases,
            we
            finish them with a non-rust, which looks aesthetically pleasing even in extreme conditions.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>All water-protected</u></p>
          <p>drives In waterjet machines, there is water and sand everywhere, which exposes the drive elements and
            linear
            bearings to damage. All drives are shielded from direct action by these factors</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Airbag Waterjet</u></p>
          <p>machines are noisy. And in particular, the stream of water in the air is loud. Even this small section
            (about
            2mm), which overcomes water from the nozzle to the material, generates a lot of noise. Therefore, in the
            machines, Kimla waterjets are installed displacement chambers (airbag) that allow you to raise the water
            surface during the cutting and lower it in order to facilitate the removal of the material. The process of
            raising the water surface takes several seconds and provides greater comfort of work also by reducing
            splashing.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Independent, external cooling</u></p>
          <p>system The pump is equipped with an external oil cooling system that allows the heat exchanger to be led
            out
            of the building, e.g. outside the building, which reduces the amount of space occupied and reduces noise</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u> 4.1 l/min at 50HP and 4150bar</u></p>
          <p>pumps with a power of 50HP and a pressure of 4150 bar have an output of 3.8l. Thanks to the modern design
            of the pump, Accustream achieved an output of 4.1 l/min</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Modern pressure booster with symmetrical seals</u></p>
          <p>The seals of the high-pressure cylinders are the same active and passive sides, which reduces the range of
            components when replacing seals.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold"><u>No threaded cylinders - pins</u></p>
          <p>Most pressure boosters have threaded cylinders that are expensive and impractical. They often bake, which
            leads to the need to replace not only the cylinders, but also the elements of the bodies cooperating with
            them, which results in multiplying operating costs. Accustream pumps use pins and unthreaded cylinders. In
            case of damage, the pins are very cheap and easy to replace.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Larger diameter cylinders</u></p>
          <p>The cylinders have a much thicker wall, which increases the life of the cylinder, which thus has a greater
            fatigue life.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Nozzles 0.014 and tubes 0.040 (1.016mm)</u></p>
          <p>In Kimla machines with pumps, Accustream 50HP can use nozzles up to 0.014 (0.36mm) and mixing tubes 0.040
            (1.016mm). With smaller pumps, only tubes up to 0.030 (0.76mm) can be used, which directly reduces
            productivity.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold"><u>Table made of galvanized sheet strips (no gratings)</u></p>
          <p> In waterjet machines, the material lies on a special grate, under which there is water that dissipates the
            energy of the water jet. The material is cut, but the grate is also cut. Often, gratings are used in
            waterjet
            cutting machines for the grate. Unfortunately, due to their small thickness, they quickly deteriorate and
            need
            to be replaced often. Kimla waterjet machines are equipped with a segment grate consisting of high strips of
            galvanized sheet, which ensures a high service life and the possibility of replacing individual ribs.</p>
